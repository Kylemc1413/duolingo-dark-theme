Turn off the lights and install a dark theme for Duolingo. This is a complete
rewrite of Duolingo Dark to match Duolingo's new look and feel.

If you have been using the old version of Duolingo Dark with Stylish for
Firefox or Stylish for Chrome then you can simply update to get the new style.

Download link: [Duolingo Dark 2](http://userstyles.org/styles/90721/duolingo-dark-2)
and [Duolingo Dark 2 (customizable)](http://userstyles.org/styles/90750/duolingo-dark-2-customizable).
Complete installation instruction below.

You can follow the [discussion page](https://www.duolingo.com/comment/1853274)
for update notification.

Currently there is no support for the Incubator.

Feedbacks and contributions are welcome!


May be useful for:

1. Reducing eye strain when studying in a dark room
2. Lovers of the dark color schemes
3. Certain display technology uses less power with dark screen


Installation instruction:

1. Install [Stylish for Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/stylish/) 
   or [Stylish for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylish/fjnbnpbmkenffdnngjfgmeleoegfcffe).
   Stylish is a Firefox/Chrome addon that lets you customize the look and feel
   of any websites by writing or installing a user style
2. Go to [Duolingo Dark 2](http://userstyles.org/styles/90721/duolingo-dark-2)
   and [Duolingo Dark 2 (customizable)](http://userstyles.org/styles/90750/duolingo-dark-2-customizable)
   and click "Install with Stylish"


To temporarily disable the user style:

In Firefox, if you want to switch styles frequently, make sure the "Addon bar"
is enabled (**View > Toolbars > Addon Bar**), now the Stylish button should be
displayed in the Addon bar (usually bottom left, but like everything else in
Firefox this can be customized). Alternatively, you can go to 
**Tools > Addons > User Styles**. You can enable, disable, edit, update, set
automatic update, or delete individual user styles here.

In Chrome, the Stylish button is to the right of the address bar.
Alternatively, you can manage your user styles by going to **Menu (the three
horizontal lines) > Tools > Extensions > Options under the Stylish entry**. You
can enable, disable, edit, update, or delete individual user styles in here.
